## Philosophy
- Start small and adapt accordingly

This repo is designed to contain a minimal amount of technologies in order to maximise agility. As your application grows and your needs change, you are expected to add on your own technologies.

- Scalability

Many of the tech selected has been battle tested and are used in many of the largest tech companies in the world. Your core tech must be able to scale and it must be able to scale fast.

- Strong free tier support

Apart from the obvious low cost = better, apps have to first prove their worth before being invested into.

- Easy to develop; Quick to configure

As will be apparent from the strong use of serverless and managed tools, this stack minimises the amount of boilerplate and setup required and allows developers to focus on actually building the app itself.
