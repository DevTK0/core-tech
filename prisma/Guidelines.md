## Naming Conventions
Please adhere to Prisma naming conventions as part of schema design and maintainence. It simplifies the code and avoids the mapping process.

- Model names must adhere to the following regular expression: [A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9_]*
- Model names must start with a letter and are typically spelled in PascalCase
- Model names should use the singular form (for example, User instead of user, users or Users)
